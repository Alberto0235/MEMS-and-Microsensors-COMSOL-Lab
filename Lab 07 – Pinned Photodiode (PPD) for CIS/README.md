# Lab 07 – Pinned Photodiode (PPD) for CIS

**Course:** MEMS and Microsensors (Master, Polimi)  
**Date of work:** December 2025  
**Author:** Alberto Marrone  
**Reference:** Course Instructor Design

## 📌 Short Summary
-   **Objective:** Simulation of a Pinned Photodiode (PPD) used in modern CMOS Image Sensors.
-   **Structure:** P++ pinned implant, N-type storage well, Transfer Gate (TG), and Floating Diffusion (FD).
-   **Physics Highlights:**
    -   **Potential Well:** Simulation of the "energy hole" where photogenerated electrons are collected, isolated from surface states (low dark current).
    -   **Charge Transfer:** Simulation of the Transfer Gate activation to move electrons from the PPD to the Floating Diffusion.
-   **Outcome:** Visualization of the complete charge transfer mechanism essential for Correlated Double Sampling (CDS).
